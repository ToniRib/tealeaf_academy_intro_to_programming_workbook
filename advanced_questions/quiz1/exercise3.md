# Advanced Questions - Quiz 1 - Exercise 3

### Question

In other exercises we have looked at how the scope of variables affects the modification of one "layer" when they are passed to another.

To drive home the salient aspects of variable scope and modification of one scope by another, consider the following similar sets of code.

What will be printed by each of these code groups?

#### Question A

```
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one = two
  two = three
  three = one
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```

#### Answer A

one is: one
two is: two
three is: three

#### Question B

```
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
    one = "two"
    two = "three"
    three = "one"
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```
#### Answer B

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

#### Question C

```
def mess_with_vars(one, two, three)
  one.gsub!("one","two")
  two.gsub!("two","three")
  three.gsub!("three","one")
end

one = "one"
two = "two"
three = "three"

mess_with_vars(one, two, three)

puts "one is: #{one}"
puts "two is: #{two}"
puts "three is: #{three}"
```

#### Answer C

one is: two
two is: three
three is: one
